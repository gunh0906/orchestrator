[TASK] ORCH-0004-T4
Owner: Codex-D
Role: History/Range
Repo: machining_monitor_server

Goal:
Remove calendar UI and replace with period selector (preset ranges + custom start/end), fully DB-backed.

Scope paths:
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_history_store.py

Done when:
- Calendar widget removed from utilization tab.
- Period selector works (day/week/month/custom).
- Queries use selected range and refresh charts/tables correctly.

Rules:
- Make minimal, safe code changes only within scope unless strictly required.
- Preserve UTF-8 and existing behavior outside task objective.
- Run quick validation and report file+line level summary.
- Write brief progress to orchestrator/status_report.md and result to orchestrator/results.md.
