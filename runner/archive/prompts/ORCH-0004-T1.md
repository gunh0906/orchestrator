[TASK] ORCH-0004-T1
Owner: Codex-A
Role: Core/Connection
Repo: machining_auto

Goal:
Fix INSPECT login noise and TNC TABLE directory change errors during machine switching.

Scope paths:
- machining_auto/machine_connection/connection_manager.py
- machining_auto/machine_connection/diagnostics/heidenhain_runtime_info.py

Done when:
- No repeated `error logging in as INSPECT` spam on unsupported controls.
- No repeated TABLE/table/Table change-directory attempts for a single request.
- Reconnect switch path remains stable.

Rules:
- Make minimal, safe code changes only within scope unless strictly required.
- Preserve UTF-8 and existing behavior outside task objective.
- Run quick validation and report file+line level summary.
- Write brief progress to orchestrator/status_report.md and result to orchestrator/results.md.
