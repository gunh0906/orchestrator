Owner: Codex-A
Role: HistoryDefault/KPI
Repo: machining_monitor_server

Goal:
Make utilization tab the default landing view and add top KPIs for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly overall averages.

Scope paths:
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/runtime/controller.py

Done when:
- Dialog opens on utilization log tab by default.
- Top KPI cards show fleet-wide daily/weekly/monthly/yearly average utilization.
- No regression in existing live runtime polling flow.

Rules:
- Keep edits minimal and UTF-8 safe.
- Reuse existing tab/widgets where possible; do not create a new app/window.
- Include brief validation notes in orchestrator/results.md.
