[TASK] ORCH-0004-T5
Owner: Codex-E
Role: Admin/AddressDB
Repo: machining_monitor_server

Goal:
Provide per-machine admin-managed address mapping storage/edit UI and persist to DB.

Scope paths:
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_history_store.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/telemetry_mapping.py

Done when:
- Admin can add/edit/remove addresses per machine.
- Address config persists and reloads from DB.
- Runtime/telemetry reads use per-machine mapping source.

Rules:
- Make minimal, safe code changes only within scope unless strictly required.
- Preserve UTF-8 and existing behavior outside task objective.
- Run quick validation and report file+line level summary.
- Write brief progress to orchestrator/status_report.md and result to orchestrator/results.md.
