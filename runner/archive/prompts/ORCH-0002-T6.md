You are executing task ORCH-0002-T6.

Owner: Codex-E
Repo: machining_monitor_server
Scope paths (do not edit outside):
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/telemetry_mapping.py
- machining_monitor_server/test_focas_connection.py

Goal:
Verify and fix value-based scan behavior so entering a value searches correctly across configured prefixes/ranges and yields deterministic matches.

Done when:
- Value mode supports exact / above / below filtering in UI and backend consistently.
- Search does not get overridden by snapshot refresh/reset logic.
- Known live address/value scenarios (e.g. iTNC530 D148 tool number) are detectable when scan range includes target.
- Result section clearly shows prefix/address/value rows, and empty-result states are explicit.

Execution constraints:
- UTF-8 only.
- Keep existing UI flow; no large redesign.
- Add concise diagnostics (what range/prefix/filter was applied) for reproducible checks.
- Update orchestrator/results.md section ORCH-0002-T6 with verification steps and outcome.
