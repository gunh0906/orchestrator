[TASK] ORCH-0005-T3
Owner: Codex-C
Role: Period/Range
Repo: machining_monitor_server

Goal:
Strengthen period controls (preset + custom) and ensure DB-backed refresh for all utilization widgets/tables.

Scope paths:
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_history_store.py

Done when:
- Period controls drive all utilization widgets consistently.
- Changing range refreshes KPI cards, fleet table, and timeline together.
- No auto-reset to unrelated snapshot/live state while in utilization tab.

Rules:
- Avoid heavy refactor outside target tab.
- Keep refresh performant and deterministic.
- Write concise diff summary to orchestrator/results.md.
