[TASK] ORCH-0005-T4
Owner: Codex-D
Role: Permission/Realtime
Repo: machining_monitor_server

Goal:
Separate realtime vs utilization by permission and keep utilization as default for web/limited roles.

Scope paths:
- machining_monitor_server/app.py
- machining_monitor_server/diagnostics/runtime_info_dialog.py
- machining_monitor_server/runtime/controller.py

Done when:
- A permission/config flag controls realtime tab visibility/access.
- Without permission, only utilization-focused workflow is visible.
- With permission, realtime remains available and functional.

Rules:
- Implement with lightweight env/config flag and safe default.
- Do not break existing CLI args.
- Record usage example in orchestrator/results.md.
